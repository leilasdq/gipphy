# Gipphy

Gipphy is a multi-module project designed for learning new technologies and concepts in Android development. This project showcases the integration of various technologies, including Jetpack Compose, Ktor, Koin, Paging, ViewModel, Clean Architecture, and Test.

## Project Overview

Gipphy is a powerful app that allows users to explore and search for GIFs using the GIPHY API. It demonstrates how to leverage modern Android development practices and frameworks to build a robust and maintainable application.

## Features

- Explore trending GIFs
- Search for specific GIFs based on keywords
- Favorite and save GIFs for future reference
- Clean Architecture design for modular and testable code
- Seamless pagination for smooth loading of GIFs
- ViewModel architecture for managing app state

## Technologies Used

- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose): A modern UI toolkit for building native Android apps.
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/): A multiplatform framework for building asynchronous servers and clients.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/): A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
- [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview): A library for gradually loading data in pages on Android.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): A component designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- Clean Architecture: A software design principle that fosters separation of concerns and maintainability.
- Test: In addition to the above technologies, the project includes various testing techniques to ensure code quality and reliability(Using [Mockk](https://mockk.io/) and [Robolectric](https://robolectric.org/)).
